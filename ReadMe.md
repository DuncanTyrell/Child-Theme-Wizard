Child Theme Wizard
==================

A WordPress plugin that creates a new Child Theme with one click from the admin interface.


Basic Usage
============

Once installed, head over to Tools - Child Theme Wizard.
Pick a parent theme, fill in the relevant details (title, description, etc) and click Create Child Theme.
Upon success you'll find you new Child Theme under Appearance - Themes. 

You have the option to include GPL License Terms if you wish.
The Wizard will automatically create a basic thumbnail too. In future versions I may include an image uplaoder for this feature.
